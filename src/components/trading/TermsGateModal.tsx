          <TermsItem n={1} title="All trading decisions and losses are yours alone.">
            Every order you place — manually, via QuickTrade, DOM, pending orders, voice trading, or any
            Expert Advisor / automated strategy — is your own decision. You accept full and sole
            responsibility for all trading results, including the total loss of your capital. Neither the
            broker nor the RAPTOR platform, its operators, or its affiliates are liable for any trading
            losses, missed profits, or consequential damages arising from your use of this platform.

          <TermsItem n={2} title="Signals, insights and analytics are information, not advice.">
            The trend signal beacon, market insights, regime classifications, entry/exit zones, risk tools,
            journal analytics and NEXUS assistant are heuristic tools computed from market data. They are
            NOT investment advice, NOT a recommendation to buy or sell, and NOT a promise of profit. They
            can be wrong. Acting on them is entirely at your own risk, and the broker and platform are
            exonerated from any losses that follow from doing so.
          </TermsItem>

          <TermsItem n={3} title="Protection tools are aids, not guarantees.">
            The Shield protection rules (daily loss circuit-breaker, equity floor, risk caps, cooldowns
            and similar) are self-imposed discipline aids that you configure and can disable. They reduce
            preventable mistakes but cannot prevent losses, may fail to trigger in adverse technical
            conditions (connectivity, data gaps), and create no liability for the broker or platform.
          </TermsItem>

          <TermsItem n={4} title="Automated strategies act as you.">
            Expert Advisors and scripts trade with your account under your authority. Backtest or tester
            results do not guarantee live performance. You are responsible for monitoring anything you
            automate.
          </TermsItem>

          <TermsItem n={5} title="Market data and execution.">
            Prices, spreads and fills can differ from displayed quotes, particularly in fast or illiquid
            markets. Platform availability is not guaranteed. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses,
            and you can lose more than an individual trade's margin.
          </TermsItem>

          <TermsItem n={6} title="Suitability.">
            Only trade with money you can afford to lose. If you do not understand these risks, do not
            trade; consider seeking independent professional advice. Nothing on this platform constitutes
            legal, tax or investment advice.
